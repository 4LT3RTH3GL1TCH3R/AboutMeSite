#  i am **no0ne**

###  i love taking things apart and putting them back together
- sometimes i just explore the guts of things
- other times, i tear them apart and rebuild them piece by piece 

###  I create games, tools, and mods across multiple languages
- **languages i work with:** `CSS`, `C++`, `C#`, `HTML`, `JAVASCRIPT`, `PYTHON`, and more 

###  Games I play
- mostly into popular titles like **Portal**, **Portal 2**, and **REPO**
